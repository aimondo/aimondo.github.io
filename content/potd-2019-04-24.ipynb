He's been hitting the ball well so far this month and Logistic Regression is very confident in him as its top pick."

So, he is certainly a less attractive pick than Markakis. He used to be a player that you could count on for average, but he is off to a slow start and finds himself batting ninth some days. However, He does have a hit in 7 of his last 8 games! He also carries a handedness advantage (lefty vs. righty). Nevertheless, the models have given both players high hit probabilities against the opposing pitcher."
