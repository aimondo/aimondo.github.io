    "Castellanos will do battle against Ervin Santana. He has hit well against him, going 9/21 (.429). Unlike Gordon, Castellanos hits second in the lineup, meaning he could see a fifth opportunity to advance our streak. The only concern that I have with taking both Gordon and Castellanos is that Gordon doesn't play until 9:07 EST, but DET plays at 1:10 EST, meaning we may not know if Gordon is in the lineup until *after* our picks are locked. If our picks are locked and Gordon doesn't play, worst case scenario is that he pinch hits and gets out, ending our streak. I think that is unlikely to happen though and I'm willing to put my streak on the line with the double down."
