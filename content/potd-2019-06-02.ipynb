He will face off against Adam Wainwright today, who the models really like to pick against. Wainwright has a 4.94 ERA and has given up 59 hits in 58 IP. Russell is 7/18 (.389) against him. A couple concerning statistics are that Wainwright has been much better at home this season and against righties like Russell. Regardless, I'll take my chances with Russell here."
