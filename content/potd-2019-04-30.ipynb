    "Jones will meet CC Sabathia, whom he has met a whopping 95 times in his career. Over that span, he has gone 26/90 (.289). Notice the possibly absurd probability that logistic regression is assigning Adam Jones for this meeting. It's basically saying that the probability of Jones getting a hit each time he gets an at-bat against CC equates to a coin flip. Remember that these models still need to be retuned after adding new features to them, but they are both reporting ~75% testing accuracy currently, which is where they were before adding the new data. \n",

    "I won't blame anyone for fading Jones today, especially if you currently have a decent streak. I'll likely take him if he ends up batting leadoff again like he did the other night (where he went 0/7). For what it's worth, he does have a .294 avg on the young season."
