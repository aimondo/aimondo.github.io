    "What a showdown. One of the games best hitters against one of its best pitchers. Degrom will be making his first start since hitting the IL with elbow soreness. We'll see if he is a different pitcher now, but the program says we don't need him to be and the numbers back that up. Yelich is 14/32 (.438) against Degrom and carries a handedness advantage (lefty vs. righty). He's also hitting .373 against right-handed pitchers and carries a batting average of .326 into this game. That last statistic is slightly misleading though, as his home/away splits are pretty dramatic. At Miller Park, he is hitting .417 with a slugging percentage of 1.271. Everywhere else though, he is only hitting .227 with a SLG of .273. Not good. To make matters worse, he will be playing in a very pitcher friendly environment (Citi Field). Nevertheless, our program is confident in the reigning NL MVP (and likely 2019 NL MVP candidate)."
