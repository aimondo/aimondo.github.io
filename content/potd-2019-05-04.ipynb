    "Better late than never! My program finally finished its first wave of tuning, which took an eye-popping 17 hours to complete! This tuning only improved my Random Forest and was just an intiial random grid search with cross-validation. The next two or three waves of tuning should be shorter but more effective. I'll go more in depth about my tuning procedure and parameters tomorrow. For now, let's look at the picks!"
