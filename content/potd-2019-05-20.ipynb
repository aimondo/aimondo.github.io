    "Most of you may not even know what team Morales plays for now. The Yankees acquired him last week, which is a good landing spot for him. If he plays tomorrow, he'll be facing Andrew Cashner, who just pitched against the Yankees in his last start. Cashner was good in that start, allowing only 4 hits in 6 IP. Let's hope that the Yankees can get to him in this start though. Morales is 7/14 (.500) against Cashner going into this meeting. He may not play tomorrow though, so if you do take him, make sure he is in the lineup!"
