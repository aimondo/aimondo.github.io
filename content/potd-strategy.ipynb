    "Beating the streak requires contestants to select 57 consecutive batters who get a hit on the day they are chosen. It __doesn't__ require you to make a pick each day though. Therefore, we only have a pick of the day when both of our models like the same player(s) and are confident that they will get a hit. Confidence is measured by having a higher average probability of getting a hit per at-bat than our predetermined threshold. <br>"
