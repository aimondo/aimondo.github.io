    "I decided to test out something that I thought could help the models recognize some of the best hitters in the league. We already had the records of every at-bat from the previous three seasons. I decided to encode the batter and pitcher names and retrain our models with them in our feature set. My hope was that this would allow them to identify some of the best hitters and some of the worst pitchers over the three year period. I think that the idea worked, because they seem to have a preference for hitters like Altuve and Trout over ones like Longoria and Cargo now. This is good and I'll continue to experiment with it. I plan on hyperparameter tuning our models throughout the weekend with the hopes that we can get their testing accuracies closer to 80% (which would be crazy). "
