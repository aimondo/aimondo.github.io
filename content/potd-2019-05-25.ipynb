He has been a lot better lately though, with a .300 BA in the last 7 days and .269 over the last 14. He also will carry a valuable handedness advantage into this matchup. I'm comfortable doubling down with him and Blackmon today (if they both play). If one of them doesn't, the program likes Braun too, so you could take him or roll with another hitter in Coors (Arenado maybe?)."
