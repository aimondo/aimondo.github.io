    "### Beating the Streak\n",
    "So how hard is it to actually beat the streak? Well let's imagine our program like a *player* and see what the odds would need to be for this player to get 57 hits in a row. Let's imagine that our hypothetical *player* has a 0.250 batting average. This means that for every at bat, this player has a 25% chance of getting a hit. If our player had 1 at bat per game, this means that this player has a 25% chance of getting a hit in a game. The chance of this player beating the streak would be __*0.250 ^ 57 = 4.8e-35*__. That's about the same probability as winning the lottery (1 in 13 million), and then consequently finding a single atom in an adult human (~10^27). In other words, impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple at-bats per game\n",
    "But we would expect our player to get multiple at-bats per game, on average a number closer to 4. This means we can just multiply the batting average by 4 right? *0.250 x 4 = 1.000??*\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately stats don't work like that. The easiest way of seeing this is that the chance of __not__ getting a hit is the same as 4 consecutive at-bats without a hit, or *0.75 ^ 4 = 0.316* . To figure out what the probability of getting a hit is, we can just take this number and subtract it from 1. Here is the formula for probability of a single game with a hit:\n",
    "\n",
    "__P (hit) = 1 - (1 - BA)^(AB)__\n",
    "\n",
    "So for our hypothetical player with a BA of 0.250, the number becomes __*P (hit) = 1 - (1 - 0.250)^(4) = 0.683*__. Extra at-bats can help a __ton__ as well. If our player had 5 at bats instead, then __*P (hit) = 1 - (1 - 0.250)^(5) = 0.763*__, which is a pretty good jump in single game probability. This means it helps to have batters early in the lineup, and extra innings are also great. The following chart shows how single game probabilities change with BA and scale with number of at-bats. \n",
